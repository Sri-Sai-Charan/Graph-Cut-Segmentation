# Graph-Cut-Segmentation
As applied in the field of computer vision, graph cut optimization can be employed to efficiently solve a wide variety of low-level computer vision problems, such as image smoothing, the stereo correspondence problem, image segmentation, object co-segmentation, cv problems that can be formulated in terms of energy minimization.
